# How to make your own GUI


the GUI is part of another github https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stefanuk12/Venyx-UI-Library/main/source.lua

to use clone the universal GUI and check its compatable with and remove things that dont work or get flaged by the anti cheat
first create a page or use current ones

local Testpage = UI:addPage("Test")
local Testsection = main:addSection("Test")

and buttons and toggels to make a good GUI
