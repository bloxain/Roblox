## Bloxhub Lua Executor

Execute code by loading it as a string using `loadstring()` with the following URL: 

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/bloxain/Roblox/raw/main/Bloxain/Start.lua"))()
```

This is where loadstrings are downloaded and executed. Feel free to learn from it!

## How to Make Your Own GUI

To help or to manually update, make a pull request or send a message in Discord. I will test it and add/not add it to the main branch.

The GUI is part of another Github repository: https://github.com/shlexware/Orion

To use it, copy and execute the Universal GUI, and check its compatibility. Remove things that don't work or get flagged by the anti-cheat.

Why use this? It has a lot of working premade things for games. The Tower of Hell and Destruction Simulator scripts were made from the Universal GUI.
