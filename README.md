# How to make your own GUI

TO HELP / MANUAL UPDATE

make a pull or send in discord ill test it and add / not add to main branch

the GUI is part of another github https://github.com/shlexware/Orion

to use copy and execute the universal GUI and check its compatable with and remove things that dont work or get flaged by the anti cheat

why use this?
it has a lot of working premade things for games the tower of hell and destuction simulator script where made from the universal GUI
